                        I spend a lot                         I spend a lot of time talking with CIOs around the world, on the infrastructure side of the house as well as the database/enterprise app side of the house. I hear first-hand, from DBAs and IT infrastructure teams alike, about the challenges they face with choosing the right infrastructure for their database and enterprise app environments. I consistently hear stories of the difficulties of meeting service-level agreements, of meeting performance objectives, of providing continuous availability, availability to recover quickly, of driving down TCO and leveraging the benefits of virtualization. Customers tell me they want a virtual, open architecture that will allow them to leverage best-in-class technologies, but are concerned about the performance impact this may have on their production databases and applications.I spend a lot of time talking with CIOs around the world, on the infrastructure side of the house as well as the database/enterprise app side of the house.
